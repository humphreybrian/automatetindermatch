# automatetindermatch
This is a simple python based program for automating tinder searches for those looking for dates on tinder but dont want to go through the hustle of either swiping left or right. The Goal is to make it smart enough swipe right when there is a female real face, and swipe left when there is no real face or there is a male face. We also want it to be able to show the matches made per day and be able to text the matches with, "Hello I am this Lazy persons Assistant, I speak on his behalf". This is a learning challenge as I come back to Opensource after a long time.

steps:
install python3
make sure you have pip 
We are going to use Selenium in this build. 
Install selenium through pip by typing, pip install selenium.
We will be using chrome browser for this exercise. Install chrome if you dont have it installed.
Then you want to install chrome webdriver. 
For windows users, make sure you add it to environment variables to make it more accessible.
link to the chrome webdriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
choose the driver for the version of your browser.
