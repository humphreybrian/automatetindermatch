# automatetindermatch
This is a simple python based program for automating tinder searches for those looking for dates on tinder but dont want to go through the hustle of either swiping left or right. The Goal is to make it smart enough swipe right when there is a female real face, and swipe left when there is no real face or there is a male face. We also want it to be able to show the matches made per day and be able to text the matches with, "Hello I am this Lazy persons Assistant, I speak on his behalf". This is a learning challenge as I come back to Opensource after a long time.
